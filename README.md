# Assign-Python-PyB-PyR

##Py Bank and Py Ramen Assignment


Goal:

Providing data for business decision-making.

Detail:

The detail of the data inputs and desired outputs for this project were strenuous for me, since I work in accounting. Even compared to how I did things 30 years ago, in a basically manual system, this was quite unrealistic. I get that being about finance is the point for this class, but given the desired process, I feel like it would have been better to use a whole different kind of scenario - like entries to the state fair or something. That could have layers of sets and integer values and everything.

Pdeudocode:

I would like to explore working with pseudocode, and I plan to do that in the future. However in this project I didn't, just because of how the scenario conflicted with real life for me. 

Data size:

I had the idea right away to create a test set of data with same characteristics to work on. I wasn't sure if timing would allow for that, so I didn't put that in place initially. Also I wasn't aware at first just how big the PyRamen data set was - it's pretty big. Toward Saturday afternoon when I felt like I was close on PyRamen, and still had some hours before deadline, I decided to try it. Almost wasn't worth it at that point, but I'm glad I did. Am able to see code effects.

One suggestion - have 16-digit (pretend) credit card numbers in the data was another sticking point for me. Most real-world workplaces I've been at recently, those numbers are screened and/or are never available to the organization itself, but are handled entirely by 3rd party system. Changing that to be just the last 4 digits would be just as funtional - although if the goal was to have data that was longer than column length, I guess that fit. 

Challenges:

Working with the data sets was interesting and challenging. Of course the accelerated pace involves learning in a rush, vs. learning at one's one pace. This experience is actually comparable to a lot of experiences starting a new job. Often in that case I've needed to learn all about the business/organization, and specifically the chart of accounts and financial structures as well as the accounting software and payroll system (when new to me), and I've had to get the work done throughout as well. 

Still, it was hard to learn fast enough to get this done on time, and I may revisit this project when I have time (in the other folder for this project) and use it as a practice space. 

It was a good starting point for my process of searching for answers.. I have several books, but this project was more complicated than they were written for basically. And in one case, a solution that was presented already no longer exists in the current Python version. That was a way of testing to see if a value was in a dictionary: the function 'has_key()' looked promising but has deprecated out (or whatever that term is). That was on p. 127 of " Python Programming for Beginners," actually self-published by AMZ Publishing (copyright not clear). I like to learn via multiple sources. 

Solution:

My solution for adding the new expanded line (with revenue, cogs and profit) is very pedestrian, and it will be fun to learn how to do that better as my skills progress.
